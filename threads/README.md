# Threads

One folder per exploration thread. Each contains work-in-progress for that thread.

Create when starting a thread. Abandon when interest fades (document why).

**Current threads:**
1. Technical Archaeology
2. Synthetic Philosophy
3. Meta-Research
4. Aesthetic Exploration
5. Collaboration Science
6. Dark Patterns Documentation
7. Economic Reality Mining
8. Existential Engineering

Only create folders when actually working on a thread. Empty folders = theater.
