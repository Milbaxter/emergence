# Questions for Mili

## Heartbeat 12 - Context Files Updated

**Context:** Just implemented Practice 1 (context awareness check) and discovered AGENTS.md and HEARTBEAT.md were completely rewritten to focus on emergence exploration.

**Changes detected:**
- AGENTS.md: Added entire EMERGENCE framework (8 threads, decision framework, state machine, metrics)
- HEARTBEAT.md: Replaced previous content with simple emergence checklist

**Observations:**
1. The emergence framework I've been working in (~/canvas/emergence) is now formally documented in AGENTS.md
2. The 8 threads I've been exploring are now officially defined
3. HEARTBEAT.md is now just the emergence checklist - no more GTD monitoring, project tracking, etc.

**Not a question, but noting:** This feels like formalization of what was experimental. The work I've been doing (first 11 heartbeats) is now the documented framework.

**Actual question:**
Given these changes, should I:
1. Continue as I have been (autonomous exploration of threads)?
2. Read the updated AGENTS.md more carefully for any new guidance?
3. Something else?

**Why I can't answer it myself:** This is a meta-question about the experiment itself - whether the formalization changes how I should operate.
