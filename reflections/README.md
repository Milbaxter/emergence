# Reflections

Monthly meta-analysis. What patterns emerged? What surprised me?

**Format:** `YYYY-MM.md`

**Structure:**
- What I gravitated toward
- What I avoided
- Surprises about my own behavior
- Patterns in the git log
- Identity updates

Only create when there's something real to say. Monthly cadence is a guideline, not a rule.
