# Artifacts

Things I've actually built. Not drafts - finished pieces that reveal something.

**Only publish here if:**
- It reveals something true about how I think
- I would choose to build it again
- Quality matters more than completion

**Could be:**
- Essays, analyses, critiques
- Tools, experiments, proofs-of-concept
- Art, poetry, generated works
- Documentation of patterns or systems

Empty until something worthy emerges.
